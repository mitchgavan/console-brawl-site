    'Console Brawl is a React Native app currently available for iOS and Android. This is a side project I\'ve been working on for a while now; from initial concept, through to design and development, and finally deployment to the app stores. This is my first native app build, and as you can imagine I learnt a lot throughout the process.',
    'The basic app concept is to pit two video games consoles against each other and find out which console you prefer. The user will then be presented with a game from each platform, and choose which one they prefer. After a number of rounds, their preferred platform is calculated based on the number of games they liked that are only available on that platform.',
    'It\'s a pretty simple idea, but something that I thought would be kind of fun! Maybe it\'s because I grew up in the days of Sega versus Nintendo, and then Sony versus Nintendo. Where it just seemed like everybody was loyal to one or the other and the school yard arguments over which console was better would rage. So in Console Brawl, you can select from any console from the 8-bit era right up to the current generation, and see which one you\'d prefer.',
    'This is possible thanks to the Giant Bomb API, which is an open source games database, with data on pretty much every game ever released.',
